# SAEF_OCR
Optical character recognition throughput autmoation for processing and accessing the contents of handwritten documents in "Enhancing Slavery, Abolition, Emancipation, and Freedom: Primary Sources from Houghton Library for Deeper Research" grant
## Background
### About the grant
This notebook represents the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) component of Houghton Library’s Slavery, Abolition, Emancipation, and Freedom: Primary Sources from Houghton Library (SAEF) project. Regarding the grant itself, PI Dorothy Berry had this to say:

"In the Summer of 2020 Houghton Library committed to focusing our project digitization for the upcoming year on a curated set of 2000+ rare and unique materials illustrating African American history from the 18th century through the turn of the 20th century. The project, in process with an internal Houghton team and colleagues in Imaging Services, is planned to culminate with two primary deliverables besides hundreds of newly cataloged and digitized primary sources: a DublinCore based dataset on the digitized records available through DataVerse, and an easy to access curated CURIOsity site. The project is guided by a trifecta of Harvard Library Values; Seek collaboration, Embrace diverse perspectives, Champion access".

A key sub-goal of the AOK SAEF grant is to provide researchers with the OCR from our digitized objects, to open research possibilities up beyond human capability. The bulk of the materials to be digitized are 19th century published materials which OCR relatively well. There are, however, many key documents that fare less well-- particularly hand-written material. Handwritten material in our collection includes letters from famed Black abolitionists, letters from formerly enslaved peoples to the Freedmen’s Bureau, personal recollections of Gullah-Geechee sacred music, and more.
